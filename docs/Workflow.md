# Game Development Workflow

At Anarchy, we have developed a game development workflow that allows us to create games from start to finish. Our process includes creating a game design document, using agile development methodologies, and designing a workflow that allows for efficient and effective development. We cover all aspects of game development, such as creating assets and designing levels, programming features, and integrating APIs and plugins. Our workflow is designed to ensure that the game is developed according to a set of quality standards and meets the needs and expectations of our target audience.

### The workflow design

The workflow cover how our team at Anarchy works. We have different teams that covers things from designing to APIs. The below images shows the how we collaborate and the process we follow.

### The level team

The level team is responsible for creating the game's environment and settings in which the player will interact. They come up with the game design concept, create the art, UI, and other elements needed to bring the environment to life. They design the layout of the game levels, including the placement of objects, enemies, and obstacles. The level team's goal is to create an engaging and challenging experience for the player that is both fun and rewarding to play.

### The modeling team

The modeling team is responsible for creating 3D models of the game's characters, objects, and environments using specialized software. They take the game design concept from the level team and bring it to life by creating complex models for it. These models can be textured, animated, and manipulated to create a realistic and immersive game world. They work with tools like Maya and Photoshop and other 3rd party assets which they buy from various sources to make the game. The modeling team plays an important role in game development as it helps bring the game's design concepts to life and gives players a visual representation of the game's world.

### The UX team

The UX team in game development is responsible for creating the user experience of the game. This includes designing the game's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), such as menus, buttons, and HUD elements. They are responsible for ensuring that the game's user interface is intuitive and easy to use, and that it provides feedback on the player's actions. The UX team also works on the game's wireframes and flowcharts, which help to define the user experience and ensure that it meets the needs of the target audience. Additionally, they may conduct user testing to ensure that the game's user experience is enjoyable and engaging.

### The animations

The animations team is responsible for creating movement for characters, objects, and environments within the game. They use specialized software to create animations that range from simple movements like walking and running to more complex actions like combat and spell casting. The animations team works closely with other teams like the modeling team to ensure that the animations are integrated seamlessly into the game. They also work with the Unity team to make sure that the animations are properly integrated into the game engine and that they interact with other elements like maps, characters, and VFX. The animations team plays a crucial role in making the game more immersive and engaging for players.

### The unity team

The Unity team is responsible for integrating all of the game's assets and modules into Unity3D, which provides tools for creating 3D and 2D games. They bring the assets to life by animating them and setting them up with other components such as maps, characters, textures, and more. This involves adding physics to the game and making it interact with other elements. The team also writes custom code in Unity3D. Their tasks include level design, 3D model integration, animations, camera, user interface, input system, VFX, AI (NPCs), code integration on modules, APIs, and plugins. They are responsible for ensuring that the game runs smoothly on different platforms and that it meets the quality standards set by the development team.

### The API team

The API team is responsible for creating and managing the game's Application Programming Interface (API). They design, develop and test the APIs and ensure that they are integrated properly into the game engine. They work closely with other teams to ensure that the APIs meet the needs of the development team. Additionally, they may provide documentation and support for other developers who use the APIs in their projects.
